            <h3>Setting Up:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You will need a table or flat surface that is 4' by 8' with a line through the center at 4'</li>
                <li>At each corner, place four pint sized glasses</li>
                <li>Two dice</li>
                <li>Four players</li>
                <li>Each player must fill their glass up with their drink of choice</li>
                <li>Set height boundary for required height on toss</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Rules:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Decide whoe starts: have one team roll a die while the other team calls high or low. A die 4 or above is high and 3 or below is low. If the team guessed right, they get to start the game.</li>
                <h6>Winning:</h6>
                <li>Typical games play up to 9 or 11 points</li>
                <li>Teams must win by at least 2 points</li>
                <li>Games cannot be won on a FIFA</li>
                <li>Tossing player must say "Die is live" or whatever agreed upon phrase to let the other team know the die is in play before tossing</li>
                <h6>Scoring:</h6>
                <li>Each player on team will toss one die on their turn</li>
                <li>Die must be tossed above height boundary and bounce off the opponent's side of the table. If the die is not caught by the opponent after the bounce, tossing team gains 1 point</li>
                <li>To prevent point, defensive team must catch die using one hand before the die touches the ground - if both hands are used to catch it is the offensive team's point</li>
                <li>If die is tossed too low or short of the opponent's side then the die is dead and goes to the opposing team - if it is argued that die was fair, a re-toss can be issued</li>
                <li>Die cannot be trapped to catch (trapping the die between hand and other body part) - this will be automatic point for other team</li>
                <li>Die cannot be caught over the table when die is live</li>
                <h6>Points:</h6>
                <li>Single points are earned when the die hits the opponent's side of the table and is not caught</li>
                <li>If die hits one of the cups on the opponent's side and is not caught, 2 points are gained by tossing team</li>
                <li>If die bounces or directly goes into the opponent's cup, this is considered a sink and worth 3 points for the tossing team. Additionally, the sunked opponent must finish their drink and refill their glass</li>
                <li>If the teams decide to have FIFA in play, if the tossing team misses the table, the defensive players can use a body part to kick the die into the air to be caught by their teammate. If caught, the defending team gains 1 point</li>
                
            </ul>
